Gleb Vseslavich (Глеб Усяславіч, Глеб Всеславич) (died September 13, 1119) was the prince of Minsk between 1101 and 1119. During his reign Minsk was at war with Kiev and Polatsk. He started the Minsk branch of Prince of Polotsk as son of Vseslav the Seer.

In 1104 his city of Minsk was under siege from the voivode Putiata, Oleg Sviatoslavich, and Yaropolk Vladimirovich, the son of Vladimir II Monomakh. In 1106 he had partaken the raid on the Baltic tribe of Semigallians.

In 1116 he started the war with the Monomakh and burned down Slutsk. In response to that Monomakh with his sons, Davyd Sviatoslavich, and sons of Oleg Sviatoslavich assaulted Minsk. The Monomakhs took Orsha, Drutsk, and took Minsk under siege. Gleb started negotiations with Vladimir who in spirit of the upcoming Easter holidays agreed to conclude a peace. Completely ignoring the conditions of the signed peace treaty, Gleb resumed his hostilities in 1119. The same year Mstislav Vladimirovich, the son of Monomakh, took Gleb as a prisoner to Kiev where the last one died shortly.
